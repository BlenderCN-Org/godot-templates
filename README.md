**Godot Version**: 3.1
**Status**: work in progress, but fully functional
**Download**: [gdnative-third-person-template-0.1.0.7z](https://github.com/Cygon/godot-templates/blob/master/releases/gdnative-third-person-template-0.1.0.7z)

This is a ready-to-run example project which uses a CharacterController written in GDNative C++ to steer a character through the scene.

It demonstrates the following
- Using SCons to export models and animations from Blender to Godot
- Using Blender's library linking feature to save animations separately from your master .blend file
- Compiling a GDNative library with SCons on different platforms
- Writing scripts that go beyond the "Hello World" example in GDNative, with physics, input and access to other nodes
